Project Pulse README
Release 0.1

By: Eric Ouyang (http://ericouyang.com)

**************
Overview
**************
Project Pulse is aimed to provide a framework for design a community website where it's a constant stream
of user generated content. Currently, the sources include Twitter and Tumblr.

Tumblr is used for the "Contribute to Pulse" feature since it's easy to use and allows for contributions
without actually having an account.

All feeds are grabbed by rss and parsed using the PHP library SimplePie

**************
Setting Up
**************
You can quickly set up your own pulse for your school, religious community, club, and more.

Although you can use it to just aggregate Twitter accounts, we'd recommend using the Tumblr aspect as well.

Sign up for a Tumblr account at http://www.tumblr.com

Go to your newly created Tumblr website and copy the url.

Configure your installation by going to includes/config.php. Type in the desired twitter users to aggregate
and set your tumblr url where noted.

Make sure the cache directory has read write permissions by the server. If not, change the folder permissions to 755 

Customize your installation with the CSS files in /css and with the templates in /templates

Go to your site and try out your brand new pulse!

Notes
**************
This is very early software. So things may break. I'm not responsible for any problems that may occur.

This was originally developed for Phillips Academy's student newspaper by Eric Ouyang '13
